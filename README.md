# SNN_stdp-learning
## Environment
Python3 
Nest 
## Tasks
1. Depend the tutorials from Nest-simulator to learn how to create the neurons.
2. Connect(topology)
3. Factors affecting the weight of stdp.
4. Create and connect the layers.
### Todo
5. Complete the network.
### Problems to be solved
How does the stdp learn weights from dataset(eg. MNIST)? --Poisson spike trains
- input --poisson
- input2output --stdp
- output
